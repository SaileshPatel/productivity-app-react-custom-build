# Description

Added functionality to delete an item to the list of tasks.

To-Do: 

- [ ] Ensure no memory leaks (need to look into memory leakage and how React event handlers can contribute)
- [ ] Avoid using ItemName as the filter in the main delete function (inaccurate as two items _could_ have the same name)
